WorldWide Network Operators Group (WwNOG)

The idea of this group is to unite all region and nationals NOGs in one

I've created a twitter account called @wwnog and an email account worldnog@gmail.com

All are welcomed to join and participate. For example by announcing next events of regional/national NOGs reunion to come.

This is a list of many NOGs to this day: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Network_Operators%27_Groups

I think it will be a good thing to integrate all NOGs in one mailman, for instance, to receive news from all over the world.

Cheers, Nicolas Cortes <ncort3s@gmail.com>./~
